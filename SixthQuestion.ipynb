Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.
Exception handling is an essential aspect of writing robust and maintainable Python code. Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:

Use Specific Exceptions:

Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle. Avoid using a broad except clause that catches all exceptions, as it can hide unexpected issues.

Keep the Try Block Minimal:

Keep the try block as small as possible. This makes it easier to identify the specific location where an exception might occur.

Avoid Bare Except Clauses:

Avoid using bare except clauses without specifying the exception type. This can make debugging challenging and lead to unintended consequences.

Use else Clause Sparingly:

While the else clause can be useful, avoid overusing it. It may complicate the control flow and make the code less readable.

Handle Exceptions Locally:

Whenever possible, handle exceptions locally where they occur. Avoid catching an exception in one part of the code and handling it far away, as it can make the code harder to understand.
Log Exceptions:

Always log exceptions to help with debugging. Use the logging module to log relevant information about the exception, including the stack trace.
